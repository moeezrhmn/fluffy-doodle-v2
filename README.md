# FastAPI Starter Package

This is a simple starter template designed to help you quickly set up a project with **FastAPI**.

## Project Structure

The package comes with a structured directory layout to ensure maintainability and scalability. Here's a breakdown of each directory and file:

### Directories

- **`api/`**: This directory is used to handle all your API endpoints, with version control implemented to organize them effectively.
  
- **`middlewares/`**: Place all your custom middleware files here. Each middleware can be managed in individual files for clarity.
  
- **`models/`**: All database models should be placed here. You can have multiple files based on the different types of models you are working with.

- **`serializers/`**: This folder contains your Pydantic models (serializers) for validating and serializing data. You can split them into multiple files as needed.

- **`services/`**: This directory should contain all your business logic and service functions.

- **`tests/`**: If you have written any test cases, this is where they should go. All your test-related files can be organized in this directory.

### Files

- **`config.py`**: This file holds the settings class, where you should store all your constants and secret keys. The values defined here can be accessed throughout the entire project.

- **`dependencies.py`**: This file contains any dependencies you define, which can be used across different parts of the application.

- **`main.py`**: This is the entry point of the FastAPI application. It initializes the FastAPI instance, configures middlewares, and defines application events.

- **`utils.py`**: This file contains any helper functions that will be reused throughout the project. Common utilities can be centralized here for easy access.
